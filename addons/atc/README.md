# Air Traffic Control

Provides ATC with a radar view of all air assets in the air, including enemy.

## TODO

- Rename to AWACS?
- Bring in E3-D and make this part of that?
- Show missile launches
- Only show enemy aircraft if any friendly aircraft has a radar track of it, plus a radius around base/carrier (radar building? player?)
